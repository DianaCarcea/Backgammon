# Backgammon Game Project
This project is developed as part of the Python laboratory sessions at our university. It is a classic backgammon game implemented using the Tkinter library for the entire user interface. The project focuses on capturing and implementing all traditional rules of backgammon, which presented a significant challenge in terms of logic and accuracy.

## Features: 
- **User Interface**: Built entirely with Tkinter, providing an intuitive and interactive experience.
- **Game Logic**: Comprehensive implementation of traditional backgammon rules.
- **Gameplay**: Supports two-player gameplay, allowing matches between two users or between a user and an AI opponent.


## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
3. Run the game using the following command:
   ```bash
   python backgammon.py
